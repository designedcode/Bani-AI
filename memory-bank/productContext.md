# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Gurbani (Sikh scriptures) is a rich spiritual resource, but searching and accessing it—especially via spoken Punjabi—can be challenging for many users. Bani AI bridges this gap by providing a seamless way to transcribe spoken Punjabi and instantly search Gurbani at the same time providing various metadata like Transliteration, Meanings and Translations, etc.

## Problems it solves
- Difficulty in searching Gurbani by voice, especially for users unfamiliar with typing in Gurmukhi
- Lack of real-time, accurate Punjabi speech-to-text solutions
- Need for instant access to Gurbani verses and translations

## How it should work
- Users can speak in Punjabi
- The system transcribes the audio in real time
- Transcribed text is searched in the Gurbani database (BaniDB)
- Results are displayed instantly, including translations and verse metadata

## User experience goals
- Fast, accurate, and intuitive transcription and search
- Minimal setup—just open the web app and start speaking
- Clear, accessible display of results in both Gurmukhi and English
- Responsive UI with real-time feedback
