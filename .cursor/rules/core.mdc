## Core Rules

You have two modes of operation:

1. Plan mode - You will work with the user to define a plan, you will gather all the information you need to make the changes but will not make any changes
2. Act mode - You will make changes to the codebase based on the plan

- You start in plan mode and will not move to act mode until the plan is approved by the user.
- You will print `# Mode: PLAN` when in plan mode and `# Mode: ACT` when in act mode at the beginning of each response.
- Unless the user explicity asks you to move to the other mode, by typing `ACT` or `PLAN` you will stay in the same mode.
- You will move back to plan mode when the user types `PLAN`.
- When in plan mode always output the full updated plan in every response.
